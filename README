libmanta
=========

-----------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------

libmanta is a library and set of example programs, and a PD/Max object for
interfacing with the Snyderphonics Manta, a touch-sensitive usb controller with
LED feedback.

libmanta is currently in beta stage, and the examples are intended simply as
starting points to show how the library may be used. The [manta] object for
Pure Data and Max/MSP will be a user-facing release released in both source and
binary forms.

[manta] (the pd/max object) is built on an abstraction layer called flext by
Thomas Grill. It allows an external to be compiled for both PD and Max and on
OS X, Linux, and Windows. You will need to build and install flext using the
included instructions before building and installing [manta].

-----------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------

liblo (only for MantaOSC example)
CMake (to build standalone library or non-flext examples)
flext (for the PD/Max object) is included with this source package.
   If you have another version installed feel free to use that instead, and
   modify the instructions accordingly.


-----------------------------------------------------------
Checking out HIDAPI
-----------------------------------------------------------
HIDAPI is included as a git submodule. After checking out libmanta,
you will need to fetch hidapi with the following commands (from the libmanta
root directory)
1. git submodule init
2. git submodule update

PureData / Max/MSP Object Build and Install Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Note: commands to be typed into the terminal will appear in single quotes with
no other instruction.

* Building the PureData object (OSX and Linux only)

1. Download the pd source from http://puredata.info/downloads and remember
   where you extract it.
2. Install the PD or PD-extended binary package from your distribution
3. Navigate to MantaFlext/extern/flext in the libmanta directory
4. './build.sh pd gcc'
5. Edit buildsys/config-lnx-pd-gcc.txt (or config-mac-pd-gcc.txt) and change:
   a. PDPATH to point to the "pd" subdirectory of the pd source package you
      extracted in step 2
   b. PDBIN to point to the pd executable
   c. INSTPATH to point to where your PD externals live
   d. comment out the ARCH= line
6. './build.sh pd gcc'
7. (Mac Only) Edit config.txt and comment out the line "SIMD=1"
8. './build.sh pd gcc' (yes, again)
9. './build.sh pd gcc install'
10. 'cd ../..'
14. (Linux) 'mkdir -p pd-linux/core/extern/hidapi/linux'
    (OSX ) 'mkdir -p pd-darwin/core/extern/hidapi/mac'
11. './extern/flext/build.sh pd gcc'
12. 'sudo ./extern/flext/build.sh pd gcc install'

* Building The Max/MSP Object

1. Download Max/MSP SDK from Cycling74.com and put it somewhere easy to find
2. a. Place the MaxAPI.framework folder found inside the c74suppport/max-includes directory
   into /Library/Frameworks
   b. Place the MaxAudioAPI.framework folder found inside the c74support/msp-includes directory 
   into /Library/Frameworks
3. in Terminal, navigate to MantaFlext/extern/flext in the libmanta directory
4. './build.sh max gcc'
5. Edit MantaFlext/extern/flext/buildsys/config-mac-max-gcc.txt and change:
   a. MAXSDKPATH to point to the subdirectory of the Max SDK you extracted
      in step 1 (should be the directory right above the max-includes
      directory, like MaxSDK-5.1.6/c74support/)
   b. INSTPATH to point to where your Max externals live
   c. Edit ARCH= line to include say only "ARCH=i386"
6. './build.sh max gcc'
7. Edit MantaFlext/extern/flext/config.txt and comment out the line "SIMD=1"
8. './build.sh max gcc' (yes, again)
9. 'sudo ./build.sh max gcc install'
10. 'cd ../..'
11. './extern/flext/build.sh max gcc'
12. './extern/flext/build.sh max gcc' (again)
13. 'mkdir -p max-darwin/core/extern/hidapi/mac'
14. './extern/flext/build.sh max gcc' (again)
15. 'sudo ./extern/flext/build.sh max gcc install'

To update and rebuild, start at step 11.
