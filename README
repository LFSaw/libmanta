libmanta

-----------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------

libmanta is a library and set of example programs, and a PD/Max object for
interfacing with the Snyderphonics Manta, a touch-sensitive usb controller with
LED feedback.

libmanta is currently in beta stage, and the examples are intended simply as
starting points to show how the library may be used. The [manta] object for Pure
Data and Max/MSP will be a user-facing release released in both source and
binary forms.

[manta] (the pd/max object) is built on an abstraction layer called flext by
Thomas Grill. It allows an external to be compiled for both PD and Max and on
OS X, Linux, and Windows. You will need to build and install flext using the
included instructions before building and installing [manta].

-----------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------

libusb-1.0
liblo (only for MantaOSC example)
CMake (to build standalone library or non-flext examples)
flext (for the PD/Max object) is included with this source package.
   If you have another version installed feel free to use that instead, and
   modify the instructions accordingly.

PureData / Max/MSP Object Build and Install Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Note: commands to be typed into the terminal will appear in single quotes with
no other instruction.

* OS X:

1. Install XCode from your OS X CD.
2. Download the latest version of libusb-1.0 from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb/files/libusb-1.0/
3. Extract the libusb-1.0 tarball
4. Navigate to the libusb directory
5. './configure'
6. 'sudo make install'
7. run the mantaswitch.sh script found in platform/osx to install the dummy driver
   that prevents the OSX hid driver from blocking our access to the manta
   NOTE: while this .kext file is installed you will be unable to use the
   non-libmanta-based manta Max object or OSC client. To switch back simply
   run the script again to uninstall it
8. reboot
9. Jump to 'Linux and OS X Common Instructions'

* Linux:

1. Install libusb-1.0 via your package manager
2. Install the "build-essential" package
3. Jump to 'Linux and OS X Common Instructions'

* Linux and OS X Common Instructions:
(to build for Max instead of PD you should mostly just be able to replace
each instance of 'pd' with 'max')

1. Download the pd source from http://puredata.info/downloads and remember
   where you extract it.
2. Navigate to extern/flext in the libmanta directory
3. './build.sh pd gcc'
4. Edit buildsys/config-lnx-pd-gcc.txt (or config-mac-pd-gcc.txt) and change:
   a. (Linux ONLY) the last line to OFLAGS+=-march=native
   b. PDPATH to point to the "pd" subdirectory of the pd source package you
      extracted in step 2
   c. INSTPATH to point to where your PD externals live
5. (Mac Only) Edit config.txt and comment out the line "SIMD=1"
6. './build.sh pd gcc'
7. './build.sh pd gcc' (yes, again)
8. './build.sh pd gcc install'
9. 'cd ../../MantaFlext'
10. '../extern/flext/build.sh pd gcc'
11. 'sudo ../extern/flext/build.sh pd gcc install'
